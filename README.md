# Kali-Dark-Restore
Restores the Kali-Dark theme in the "Kali Linux 2024.4" update and fixes terminal syntax highlighting for Zsh. The script also creates a backup of your current Zsh highlighting configuration, ensuring nothing is lost.

# Installation
Restoring the Kali-Dark theme with this script is pretty straightforward. Just run the script and follow the instructions. Before executing the script, you may want to run `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade` first. OffSec might release a fix soon, which could make this script obsolete, so always check for updates beforehand!

```
